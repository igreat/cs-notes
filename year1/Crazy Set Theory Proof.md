Prove this:
$$(A \cap B \cap C) \subset ((A \triangle B) \triangle C)$$
My proof:
I prove by contrapositive, if $x \not \in ((A \triangle B) \triangle C)$, then I show that it's also not in $(A \cap B \cap C)$.

Let $x \not \in ((A \triangle B) \triangle C)$. RTP: $x \not \in (A \cap B \cap C)$, and thus $x \in A^C \lor x \in B^C \lor x \in C^C$
Too much to type but by simplifying $x \not \in ((A \triangle B) \triangle C)$ as much as possible and being very careful, we get a portion of it that is always part of $x \in A^C \lor x \in B^C \lor x \in C^C$.
