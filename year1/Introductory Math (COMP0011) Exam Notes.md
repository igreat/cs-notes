## Exam 2022 LSA
### Differential Calculus
In (1.2), I ended up forgetting the square root üò´ should have been $x = ¬±\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}},0$
In section 1 overall I would mistakingly write $x$ as the variable when the function is in terms of $t$.
### Matrices
In (2.3), my mistake was getting $13 + 5 = 17$ (WRONG), $13 + 5 = 18$ (CORRECT). Always check with a calculator.
### Probabilities
(4.3), I don't know why I got $\frac{5}{6}^9 \approx 0.005$ (when it should be $~$$\approx 0.193$). Calculator sux üòï
## Exam 2022 Main
(1.1) I forgot to take the absolute value for $v_1$ and $v_2$ in this one ü§¶üèΩ

(1.2) Perhaps do the same as Hugo and just point out that the $|v|$ grows with $n$

(1.5) was pretty hard. The reason I was stuck was because I didn't have a direct way of associating boundedness of $z_n$ with boundedness of $\overline{z_n}$. The key here was to make use of the definition given to us earlier that boundedness is really related to boundedness of $|z_n|$, making the association between $z_n$ and $\overline{z_n}$ trivial. 

(1.6) was hardest question for me in this test (when it really shouldn't have been). I just needed to realize that squaring a complex number also squares its magnitude (clear from exponential form). The rest was easy. (also proof by induction here).

(3.6) I noticed this during the test actually, but I ended up proving the linearity of $D$ in the general case (or at least $\mathbb{R}_n[X]$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$) when I only needed to prove it for $\mathbb{R}_2[X]$. 

(4.6) I made the mistake of writing $I_5$ in terms of $I_4$ when it should have been in terms of $I_3$. Same with the rest. Whoops!

(1.2) I made a mistake thinking $P(2)$ was actually $P(0)$. Whoops.

(1.5) Roots of unity here makes this problem MUCH simpler. Still could have probably arrived at the full answer without it though (for example I got 4 roots, the others I suspect are just not simplified enough).

(2.7) Not sure how rigorous this is. I said 
	*since it is strictly monotone it will cross the x axis once, resulting in only 1 real root.*

(3.6) First question to completely bewilder me üóø. I could NOT solve this one within the time limit or even sometime after. Nonetheless, I had the right idea it was just WAY too many terms and variables to keep track of that I kept making mistakes. The solution was to do induction on $n$ where the step case should have looked like this after some simplifications:
$$
\Big(w_n + \frac{2}{3}\Big) \cdot \Big(U_n + (n+1)\Big)
$$
This formulation of the step case makes things much easier and less error prone so simplifications arise much more clearly.

(4.1) I shouldn't have hand-wavingly said "Since $V$ is a linear map, its image $\text{Im}(V)$ is a subspace of $\mathcal{M}_n(R)$. It's not that hard to show that $\text{Im}(V)$ is a vector space. I just need to show its addition closure and scalar multiplication closure individually (very easy when $V$ is a linear map).

(4.4) I got this right but I had to redo the whole thing 3 times! Take things slowly when doing these, the time cost of a mistake is much higher than the benefit of doing this fast.
